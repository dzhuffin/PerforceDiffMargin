# Perforce Diff Margin

Perforce Diff Margin displays live Perforce changes of the currently edited file on Visual Studio margin and scroll bar.

## Perforce connection setup

To configure Perforce connection Helix Server system variables mechanism is used.
You can set up them from the plugin. Just open settings in the "Perforce Diff Margin Configuration" toolbar.

[p4 set](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/v18.1/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/p4_set.html) is called under the hood to configure client, workspace and username.
These 3 things are required to connect. 
1. [P4PORT](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/v17.1/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/P4PORT.html) is the address of the repository.
2. [P4USER](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/v18.1/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/P4USER.html) is your username
3. [P4CLIENT](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/v18.1/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/P4CLIENT.html) is workspace name. A few workspaces can exist on 1 machine, so this information is also needed for correct margins.

You can set up the variables manually and connect via P4V desktop client. In this case, the plugin will connect automatically.
Usually, workspace(P4CLIENT variable) is not set by default.

You can use connect/disconnect in case something get wrong or you want to change the user for example.
One more usual case: if you lose internet connection the plugin can't work because perforce require a connection for p4 diff. But when you go online again plugin can't know that connection is OK. Here connect button can help.
